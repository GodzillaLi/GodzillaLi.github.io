My research is driven by my passion for generative AI. From GANs to Diffusion Models, generative models have made great progress. GhatGPT has demonstrated the great potential and application value of text generation, and image generation has also been widely used, but there are still many problems to be solved in video, 3D and 4D generation. Currently, I focus on three key areas:

- Diffusion Models: I am exploring methods to enhance the controllability, personalization, and robustness of diffusion models, ensuring that the content it generates meets the needs of engineering practice.
- 3D Gaussian Splatting: I am investigating the capabilities and limitations of 3DGS, focusing on its applications in the areas of text-to-3D and image-to-3D, while addressing concerns related to personalization, texture bias, and fineness.
- AI for Medicine & Healthcare: I am interested in leveraging AI to improve healthcare outcomes, from disease diagnosis and treatment planning to drug discovery and personalized medicine. My goal is to develop AI solutions that are safe, effective, and accessible to all.
